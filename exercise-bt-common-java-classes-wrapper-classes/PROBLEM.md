## Problem Statement: Determine the type of primitive value and convert to its Wrapper class value ##

**Given a primitive value, determine primitive type and convert given primitive type value to its Wrapper class value**

**This exercise contains a class named WrapperClassConvert with the following method:**

    +convertToWrapper(object) : object 
        -Should accept object of primitive type as input and return Object of wrapper class as result 
        -Should determine and convert given primitive type to its wrapper class
        -Should return "Give proper primitive as input" if object is null or not primitive type of data

## Example
    Sample Input:
    10
    
    Expected Output:   
    10

    Sample Input:
    "Programming"
    
    Expected Output:
    Give proper primitive type as input
    
## Instructions
