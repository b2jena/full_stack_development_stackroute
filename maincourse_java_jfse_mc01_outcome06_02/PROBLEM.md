## Problem Statement: Understanding Custom Functional Interface, Generic and Lambda expression ##

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Write Test classes in TDD approach 
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

  ```
   In this problem, two lambda expressions should be written for the following functionality using the same functional interface 
        
   - Following functionality needs to be implemented in TDD approach
   
        - Given an input String should return the string in changed case
        - Given an input number should return the cube of that number
   
   - Empty and null inputs should be checked 
   ```  
Interface MyFunction must be implemented using TDD for the following abstract method 

    + doJob(T t): T
             returns T
Class CustomFunctionalInterfaceImplementation must be implemented using TDD  

    + Use a lambda expression to return the cube of a given number                                 
    + Use a lambda expression to return the string with changed case
             
                   
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
