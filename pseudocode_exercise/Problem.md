# Exercise - Writing Pseudocode and Working with Scratch

**The learner has to write pseudocode for the problem statements given here. The learner can create projects in Scratch tool for each exercise and test the logic**

**The exercise also contains a case study on developing logic for game using Scratch tool** 

---

### Problem Statements

The 10 problem statements for the pseudocode exercises are listed below.

Please ensure that Scratch tool should be used to confirm the logic of the pseudocode.

#### Exercise 1:-
Write pseudocode for accepting radius and calculate the area of the circle.

#### Exercise 2:-
Write pseudocode for accepting a number and display the multiplication table of the given number.

#### Exercise 3:-
Write pseudocode for checking whether given number is perfect number or not.

#### Exercise 4:-
Write pseudocode accepting three numbers and display the lowest number out of three numbers.

#### Exercise 5:-
Write pseudocode to swap two numbers without using third variable.

#### Exercise 6:-
Write pseudocode for accepting a number and check whether number is perfect square or not.

#### Exercise 7:-
Write pseudocode for accepting a number from 1 to 7 and display the name of the week.

#### Exercise 8:-
Write pseudocode for implementing the concept of menu driven calculator which will accept two numbers and perform the calculation based upon users choice like
(+,-,*,/).

#### Exercise 9:-
Write pseudocode to accept student Details like (StudentID, StudentName, StudentAge, Marks1, Marks2,Marks3) Calculate Total and Percentage. If percentage is
greater than 50 then display “PASS” else display “FAIL”.

#### Exercise 10:-
Write pseudocode for printing fibonacci series upto 100

#### Case Study:- 
**Game :: Shooting the Balloon**

In this game the objective is to shoot moving targets on the screen in mid-flight. Object will fly around the screen, controlled by the mouse. When the mouse button is pressed, a gunshot will fire. When the object is hit, there should be some special effects like sound and color effect. 

In this case study, as a programmer we expect you to do the following:

1. Write the algorithm in detail which must cover all the steps related to game developent, how this game will work, which must include each and every step required to achieve the final objective. In Step-1 of this game minimum ten objects to be displayed to the player for hit and once the game is over program must display the score based upon the number of hits made by the player.

2. Draw the flow chart to demostrate the flow of the program

3. Use scratch tool to implement the game by using various blocks available in scratch


### Instructions

1. Fork the [boilerplate](https://gitlab-cgi.stackroute.in/stack_problem_solving_techniques_boilerplates/pseudocode_exercise) repository
2. In the machine locally, download Scratch software from [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)
3. You may even use the online option available for working with Scratch by clicking [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted)
4. For each problem statement, create a project in Scratch and identify the actions to be performed.
5. Choose the Go button (green flag) option in Scratch to execute and test the steps defined.
6. Ping the mentor over Slack for queries and/or exercise completion status updation.
