# Exercise - Writing Pseudocode and Working with Scratch

#### Objective : Write Pseudocode

In this exercise the learner is expected to write pseudocodes

The pseudocode is a program logic written in simple easy to understand logic.

The pseudocode has a large resemblance to the language specific programming instructions

The pseudocode is a powerful problem solving technique which helps the learner to define the logic and translate it easily into the language specific source code.

This exercise also contains a case study for developing logic for a game using the tool Scratch

The tool Scratch is a very user-friendly and interactive tool.

This tool will help learner cultivate logical thinking and identify steps required to be performed for generating the required outcome
