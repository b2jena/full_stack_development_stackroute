## Problem Statement: Find the longest substring that appears at both ends of a given StringBuilder ##

**Given a string, find the longest substring that appears at both ends of a given StringBuilder**

**This exercise contains a class named LongestSubString with the following method:**

    +findLongestSubString(StringBuilder) : StringBuilder 
        -Should accept StringBuilder as input and return StringBuilder
        -Should find the longest substring that appears at both ends of a given StringBuilder
        -Should return "Longest substring is not present in the given StringBuilder" if longest substring does not exist
        -Should return "Give proper input" if input is empty StringBuilder

## Example
    Sample Input:
    playerplay
    
    Expected Output:   
    play
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    playerplays
    
    Expected Output:
    Longest substring is not present in the given StringBuilder
