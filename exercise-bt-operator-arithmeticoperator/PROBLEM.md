## Problem Statement: Find the perimeter of a rectangle ##

**Given length and breadth of a rectangle calculate the perimeter of the rectangle**

**This exercise contains a class named RectanglePerimeter with the following methods:**

     +perimeterCalculator(double length,double breadth) : double  
         - Should take two numbers and return a number as result
         - The logic for finding perimeter should be implemented in this method
-------------------------------------------------------
     +getValues() : void
         - Should get user input from the console using scanner
         - Should pass the values to method perimeterCalculator
         - Should print the return value from the method perimeterCalculator   

## Example
    Sample Input:
    Enter length and breadth of the rectangle:
    12 10
    
    Expected Output:
    44.0
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    Enter length and breadth of the rectangle:
    105.45 200.10
    
    Expected Output:
    611.1
